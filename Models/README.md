Naming convention for dataset and models:

P = 'perfect' - the deterministic (no noise) channel opening protocol

IP = 'imperfect' - the noise channel opening protocol

uT = 'uniform temperature'

To use the models, use 'model_analysis.py' and load corresponding dataset here as training set then predict.
