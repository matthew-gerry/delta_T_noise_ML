Analyzing shot noise due to a temperature difference in a nanoscale junction using machine learning.

This repository includes a program that trains a neural network (using Keras) to predict the temperature difference, delta T, between two metallic leads, based on the average temperature, shot noise, and conductance measurements taken in a nanoscale break-junction experiment. The experiment is described in the article linked at nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0592-2.

Additional scripts are used to visualize the experimental data, explore how transmission channels open sequentially, and generate additional synethetic data with hopes of utilizing it in the training of the model.

The ongoing work is a collaboration with Jonathan J. Wang, Joanna Li, and Dvira Segal.
